# Credits
This code was written to solve a voluntary programming exercise in Staford's online cryptography course: `https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto`
I am publishing my code here because the exercise is voluntary and the forum is rather inactive due to the age of the course. 

The WebExamplePaddingOracle is essentially a 1:1 copy of the code provided in the lecture. 

# Usage
### Using custom oracle
For the attacker, oracles only have one requirement: A str -> bool function named query, that returns whether the tried pad is valid. 
The given string will be a hex encoding of the bytes of the block.

### Attacker
Attacker-objects need an oracle as well as the ciphertext as a hexstring. Custom blocksize is optional and 16 bytes by default. 
When using `.attack(<flag>)` a flag can be set, whether the attack should be carried out verbosely. By default this is set to False. 

The attack then is carried out, which depending on the type of oracle used, can take quite some time. When tried with the local example oracle execution takes mere seconds, though.

### Examples
The script carrying out the exploit itself is `exploitpaddingoracle.py`. The other scripts contain example oracles on which the exploit can be used. 
Here, I have documented pracical use-cases in code.
